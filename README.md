This case study delves into a real-world public dataset obtained from Divvy, a bike-sharing company jointly operated by the City of Chicago and Motivate International Inc. Divvy operates a city-wide network of docking stations, offering access to bicycles for both annual members and casual users with single-ride or day passes. During the period of June 2020 to July 2021, the dataset encompasses over four million rides.

The primary objective of this case study is to examine the distinctions between members and casual users, as well as analyze the overall usage patterns of the system, including traffic volume and flow. Throughout the analysis, the R programming language has been employed as the primary analytical tool.
