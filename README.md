Luca Reolon

The focus of this case study is to examine an authentic public dataset obtained from Divvy, a cooperative bike-sharing business between the City of Chicago and Motivate International Inc. Divvy’s services are accessible to both annual members and casual users, who can acquire a single-ride or day pass to access the bikes located at docking stations throughout the city. Over 5.8 million rides were taken from March 2022 to February 2023. To go through the analysis, the writing structure will follow Google Data Analytics framework: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act, utilizing R in RStudio for the entire analysis.. The public data can be found on (<https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html>).

The primary objective of this case study is to examine the distinctions between members and casual users, as well as analyze the overall usage patterns of the system, including traffic volume and flow. Throughout the analysis, the R programming language has been employed as the primary analytical tool.

This analysis is an exercise, a capstone project to [Google’s Data Analytics Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics).
